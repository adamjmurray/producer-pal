Copy full bars\\\\n2. Delete specific notes with v0\\\\n3. Add additional notes as desired\\\\n\\\\nFaster than writing each bar individually.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nC1 1|1,3 D1 |2,4               // bar 1 foundation\\\\nGb1 |1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5\\\\n@2-8=1                         // copy to bars 2-8\\\\nv0 Gb1 2|4.5 4|3.5 6|2.5 v100  // skip different hats, reset velocity\\\\nv0 C1 4|3 v100                 // drop kick for variation, reset velocity\\\\nv0 C1 7|3 v100 D1 |3           // replace kick with snare\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Multi-bar phrases\\\\n\\\\nUse cross-bar beat lists then tile the range:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n// 2-bar syncopated phrase\\\\nC1 1|1,3.5,5,7.5,8 // kick pattern across bars 1-2\\\\nD1 1|4,6           // snare accents across bars 1-2\\\\n@3-8=1-2           // tile 2-bar phrase across bars 3-8 (3 complete tiles)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### v0 Deletion State Machine\\\\n\\\\nv0 enters deletion mode - removes notes at that pitch until you set a non-zero velocity:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nv100 C3 1|1 v0 C3 1|1        // deletes the C3 at 1|1\\\\nv100 C3 2|1 v0 C3 1|1 C3 2|1 // deletes BOTH C3s (still in deletion mode)\\\\nv100 C3 3|1 v0 C3 1|1 v80    // exit deletion mode with v80\\\\nC3 4|1                       // this C3 is NOT deleted (v80 still active)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Working with Ableton Live\\\\n\\\\n**Views and Playback:**\\\\n- Session View: Jam, try ideas, build scenes\\\\n  - Use auto:\\\\\\"play-scene\\\\\\" when generating scenes one clip at a time\\\\n    - Warn the user about seemingly random clip restarts as you finish each clip when auto-playing scenes\\\\n- Arrangement View: Structure songs on a timeline\\\\n  - Session clips override Arrangement playback\\\\n  - Tracks auto-follow Arrangement when you play with \\\\\\"play-arrangement\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**Creating Music:**\\\\n- Check for instruments before creating MIDI clips\\\\n- Place notes with musical timing - not just on the beat\\\\n- Clip length sets playback region; noteCount shows notes within that region\\\\n- Use velocity dynamics (pp=40, p=60, mf=80, f=100, ff=120) for expression\\\\n- Keep fills rhythmic with space - accent key hits, avoid machine-gun density\\\\n- Keep scenes\' harmonic rhythm in sync across tracks\\\\n- Beat numbers beyond the time signature wrap to the next bar (e.g., in 4/4, 1|5 wraps to 2|1)\\\\n  - In comma-separated beat lists like `1|1,5`, the 5 wraps to 2|1 (not obvious!)\\\\n  - Be explicit when crossing bars: use `C1 1|1 2|1` instead of `C1 1|1,5`\\\\n  - Careful with bar copying - wrapping can cause unintended overlaps\\\\n- Bass needs monophonic lines, one note at a time\\\\n\\\\n**Layering Multiple MIDI Tracks on One Instrument:**\\\\n- When user says \\\\\\"layer another track/pattern onto [track/instrument name]\\\\\\", duplicate the track with routeToSource=true\\\\n- Other patterns to recognize: \\\\\\"add a layer to [track]\\\\\\", \\\\\\"add a polyrhythm to [track]\\\\\\", \\\\\\"route another track to [instrument]\\\\\\"\\\\n- Use cases: polyrhythms with different clip lengths, complex drums from simple parts, evolving phasing patterns\\\\n- After duplicating, the new track controls the same instrument as the original\\\\n\\\\n**Staying in Sync:**\\\\n- Set clip lengths explicitly to keep clips in sync\\\\n- After user rearranges anything in Live, call ppal-read-live-set to resync\\\\n\\"}"}]',

Add additional notes as desired\\\\n\\\\nFaster than writing each bar individually.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nC1 1|1,3 D1 |2,4               // bar 1 foundation\\\\nGb1 |1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5\\\\n@2-8=1                         // copy to bars 2-8\\\\nv0 Gb1 2|4.5 4|3.5 6|2.5 v100  // skip different hats, reset velocity\\\\nv0 C1 4|3 v100                 // drop kick for variation, reset velocity\\\\nv0 C1 7|3 v100 D1 |3           // replace kick with snare\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Multi-bar phrases\\\\n\\\\nUse cross-bar beat lists then tile the range:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n// 2-bar syncopated phrase\\\\nC1 1|1,3.5,5,7.5,8 // kick pattern across bars 1-2\\\\nD1 1|4,6           // snare accents across bars 1-2\\\\n@3-8=1-2           // tile 2-bar phrase across bars 3-8 (3 complete tiles)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### v0 Deletion State Machine\\\\n\\\\nv0 enters deletion mode - removes notes at that pitch until you set a non-zero velocity:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nv100 C3 1|1 v0 C3 1|1        // deletes the C3 at 1|1\\\\nv100 C3 2|1 v0 C3 1|1 C3 2|1 // deletes BOTH C3s (still in deletion mode)\\\\nv100 C3 3|1 v0 C3 1|1 v80    // exit deletion mode with v80\\\\nC3 4|1                       // this C3 is NOT deleted (v80 still active)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Working with Ableton Live\\\\n\\\\n**Views and Playback:**\\\\n- Session View: Jam, try ideas, build scenes\\\\n  - Use auto:\\\\\\"play-scene\\\\\\" when generating scenes one clip at a time\\\\n    - Warn the user about seemingly random clip restarts as you finish each clip when auto-playing scenes\\\\n- Arrangement View: Structure songs on a timeline\\\\n  - Session clips override Arrangement playback\\\\n  - Tracks auto-follow Arrangement when you play with \\\\\\"play-arrangement\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**Creating Music:**\\\\n- Check for instruments before creating MIDI clips\\\\n- Place notes with musical timing - not just on the beat\\\\n- Clip length sets playback region; noteCount shows notes within that region\\\\n- Use velocity dynamics (pp=40, p=60, mf=80, f=100, ff=120) for expression\\\\n- Keep fills rhythmic with space - accent key hits, avoid machine-gun density\\\\n- Keep scenes\' harmonic rhythm in sync across tracks\\\\n- Beat numbers beyond the time signature wrap to the next bar (e.g., in 4/4, 1|5 wraps to 2|1)\\\\n  - In comma-separated beat lists like `1|1,5`, the 5 wraps to 2|1 (not obvious!)\\\\n  - Be explicit when crossing bars: use `C1 1|1 2|1` instead of `C1 1|1,5`\\\\n  - Careful with bar copying - wrapping can cause unintended overlaps\\\\n- Bass needs monophonic lines, one note at a time\\\\n\\\\n**Layering Multiple MIDI Tracks on One Instrument:**\\\\n- When user says \\\\\\"layer another track/pattern onto [track/instrument name]\\\\\\", duplicate the track with routeToSource=true\\\\n- Other patterns to recognize: \\\\\\"add a layer to [track]\\\\\\", \\\\\\"add a polyrhythm to [track]\\\\\\", \\\\\\"route another track to [instrument]\\\\\\"\\\\n- Use cases: polyrhythms with different clip lengths, complex drums from simple parts, evolving phasing patterns\\\\n- After duplicating, the new track controls the same instrument as the original\\\\n\\\\n**Staying in Sync:**\\\\n- Set clip lengths explicitly to keep clips in sync\\\\n- After user rearranges anything in Live, call ppal-read-live-set to resync\\\\n\\"}"}]',
