# Getting Started

Welcome to Producer Pal! This guide will help you get started with using AI for
music production in Ableton Live.

## What is Producer Pal?

Producer Pal is a **natural language interface** for Ableton Live. It translates
your ideas into actions, letting you work at the speed of thought instead of
clicking through menus.

Instead of:

- Manually placing 64 kick drum notes
- Mousing through menus to duplicate and route tracks
- Copying and pasting patterns bar by bar

You describe what you want, and Producer Pal handles the tedious execution. You
stay in the creative flow.

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions for your preferred AI platform, see the
[Installation Guide](/installation/).

The installation guide covers setup for:

- **[Claude Desktop](/installation/claude-desktop)** - Recommended for most
  users

  interface supporting Gemini, OpenAI, and more
