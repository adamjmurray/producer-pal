# Getting Started

Welcome to Producer Pal! This guide will help you get started with using AI for
music production in Ableton Live.

## What is Producer Pal?

Producer Pal is an AI-powered music production assistant that integrates
directly with Ableton Live through a Max for Live device. It uses the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) to enable AI models to control Ableton Live, allowing you
to:

- Generate musical ideas and compositions using natural language
- Create and manipulate MIDI clips, tracks, and scenes
- Explore creative variations and arrangements
- Automate repetitive production tasks
