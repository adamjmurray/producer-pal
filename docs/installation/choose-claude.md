# Using Claude with Producer Pal

Anthropic's Claude models work great with Producer Pal. A free tier is available
with an Anthropic account, but has low usage limits. A subscription ($20/mo Pro)
is recommended for regular use.

## Options

| [Claude Desktop](./claude-desktop) | Most users             | Easiest setup, best experience. Desktop app required. |
| [claude.ai](./claude-web)          | Browser-only workflows | Requires [web tunnel](./web-tunnels) setup.           |
| [Claude Code](./claude-code)       | Developers             | Terminal-based, great for coding workflows.           |

## Recommendation

**Claude Desktop** is the easiest and most reliable option. It's what Producer
Pal was originally built for.

## Model Notes

- The latestClaude Sonnet or Opus is recommended for complex musical tasks
- Haiku works for simple operations but may struggle with anything complicated
