# Using Claude with Producer Pal

Anthropic's Claude models work great with Producer Pal. Requires a subscription
($20/mo Pro) or API credits.

## Options

| Option                             | Best For               | Trade-offs                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| [Claude Desktop](./claude-desktop) | Most users             | Easiest setup, best experience. Desktop app required. |
| [claude.ai](./claude-web)          | Browser-only workflows | Requires [web tunnel](./web-tunnels) setup.           |
| [Claude Code](./claude-code)       | Developers             | Terminal-based, great for coding workflows.           |

## Recommendation

**Claude Desktop** is the easiest and most reliable option. It's what Producer
Pal was originally built for.

## Model Notes

- Claude Sonnet 4 or Opus 4.5 recommended for complex musical tasks
- Haiku works for simple operations but may struggle with multi-step
  arrangements
