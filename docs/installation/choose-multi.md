# Using Multiple AI Providers

Want flexibility to switch between providers or access many models?

## OpenRouter

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) provides access to 100+ models through a
single API key with pay-per-use pricing. Access it via the
[Built-in Chat UI](./chat-ui-other-providers#openrouter).

### Why OpenRouter?

- **Model variety:** Switch between Claude, Gemini, GPT, Mistral, and more
- **Cost optimization:** Use cheaper models for simple tasks, powerful ones for
  complex work
- **Single billing:** One account for all providers
- **Availability:** Fallback options when one provider is rate-limited

### Recommended Models

- **Gemini 3 Flash** - fast and capable
- **Claude Opus 4.5** - strong reasoning
- **GPT-5.2** - solid all-rounder
- **Mistral Large** - competitive performance and pricing

## Other OpenAI-Compatible Providers

The Chat UI also supports direct connections to other providers like Groq,
Together AI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. See the
[Custom Providers setup](./chat-ui-other-providers#custom-providers) for
details.
