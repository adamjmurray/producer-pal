## LM Studio (Advanced)

::: warning For Power Users

LM Studio requires significant hardware (Apple Silicon with lots of RAM or
Nvidia 4080+ GPU) and technical comfort with local models. Expect
experimentation. Online options work better and faster at this time.

:::

- **Difficulty:** Advanced
- **Cost:** Free (uses your hardware)
- **Best for:** Privacy-focused users with capable hardware
