# Web Apps

Use Producer Pal in your browser with claude.ai or ChatGPT.

::: warning Requires Web Tunnel Web apps cannot connect to localhost. You must
set up a [web tunnel](./web-tunnels) (Cloudflare or Pinggy) to expose your local
Producer Pal server. :::

## Available Options

| Web App                   | Provider  | Cost         |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| [claude.ai](./claude-web) | Anthropic | Subscription |
| [ChatGPT](./chatgpt-web)  | OpenAI    | Subscription |

## Why Use Web Apps?

- No desktop app installation required
- Works on any device with a browser
- Same AI capabilities as desktop versions

The main tradeoff is the extra step of setting up a web tunnel.
