      and scenes, edit MIDI and audio clips, and build arrangements without
      clicking.

  - title: Complex Edits Made Simple
    details:
      Apply transformations that would be tedious by hand, like "shift every
      third note down an octave" or "fade out velocities over 8 bars". Explore
      variations and experiment with patterns.

  - title: Works Online or Offline
    details:
      Use cloud AI services (Claude, Gemini, GPT) or run completely offline with
      local models (Ollama, LM Studio). Includes a built-in chat UI to get
      started quickly.

  - title: Open Source & Free Forever
    details:
      MIT licensed and developed completely in the open. No subscriptions, no
      paywalls, no premium features. Fork it, modify it, use it however you
      want.

## Data Privacy

When using online AI services, your musical data (MIDI notes, track names,

to opt out of training on your data. Check your AI provider's privacy policy and
