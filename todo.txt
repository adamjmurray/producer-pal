Limitations

While Producer Pal is powerful, understanding its limitations will help you work more effectively and
avoid frustration. 
These limitations exist because certain Ableton Live features require direct
interaction with the software's user interface or file system.

Cannot Load Library Content
Producer Pal cannot load presets, kits, or samples from Ableton's library. This includes drum kits,
instrument presets, effect presets, and audio samples. You must load these manually by dragging
them from Ableton's browser to the appropriate location. Once loaded, Producer Pal can work with
and modify the devices.

Cannot Record
Recording audio or MIDI input is not supported. Producer Pal creates content programmatically by
writing notes and configuring devices, but it cannot capture real-time performances from your
instruments or MIDI controllers.

Cannot Access the Browser
The Ableton browser is not accessible through Producer Pal. You cannot search for sounds, browse
categories, or preview content. All library browsing must be done directly in Ableton Live.

Cannot Load External Plugins
Third-party VST and AU plugins cannot be loaded by Producer Pal. Only native Ableton devices can
be created. However, if you manually load a plugin, Producer Pal may be able to read and modify
some of its parameters, depending on how the plugin exposes them to Ableton.

Cannot Export
Exporting and rendering functions are not available. You must export your final audio or video files
manually through Ableton Live's export menu.
