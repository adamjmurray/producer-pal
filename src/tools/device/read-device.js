/**
 * Read information about a specific device by ID.
 *
 * HISTORICAL NOTE (Sept 2025):
 * This tool was created as a fallback mechanism for a hypothetical edge case where
 * read-track would fail due to massive numbers of nested rack devices. In practice,
 * this has never been needed because:
 *
 * 1. Performance improvements (chunking, better timeouts) solved the underlying issues
 * 2. The overhauled include system with sensible defaults prevents most timeouts
 * 3. ppal-init separates initialization from reading, reducing initial load
 * 4. No real-world use case has emerged requiring direct device access by ID
 *
 * The tool is implemented but not exposed via MCP to save context window space.
 * If you ever encounter projects where read-track consistently fails due to
 * device complexity, this tool can be re-enabled by uncommenting its registration
 * in create-mcp-server.js.
 *
 * Last verified unused: Sept 2025 (searched all conversations, zero organic usage)
