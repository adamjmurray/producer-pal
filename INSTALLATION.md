## Upgrading

When installing a new version of Producer Pal:

1. **Download all new files:** Get the latest
   [`Producer_Pal.amxd`](https://github.com/adamjmurray/producer-pal/releases/latest/download/Producer_Pal.amxd)
   Max for Live device, and (if applicable) either
   [`Producer_Pal.mcpb`](https://github.com/adamjmurray/producer-pal/releases/latest/download/Producer_Pal.mcpb)
   (for Claude Desktop) or
   [`producer-pal-portal.js`](https://github.com/adamjmurray/producer-pal/releases/latest/download/producer-pal-portal.js)

2. **Replace the Max device:** Replace `Producer_Pal.amxd` in the location where
   you originally saved it (e.g. in your Live User Library). Live projects
   referencing this location will automatically use the new version.

   **Exception:** If you saved projects with "Collect All and Save" (with device
   files included), those have their own copy of Producer Pal. For those
   projects, drag the new `.amxd` into Live to replace the old version.

   Check the version number in the device UI to confirm you're running the
   latest version.

3. **For Claude Desktop users:**
   - Go to Settings → Extensions
   - Click the `...` menu on the old Producer Pal extension and select
     "Uninstall"
   - Install the new `Producer_Pal.mcpb` file (see
     [Claude Desktop installation](#claude-desktop))

4. **For other setups:** Replace the old `producer-pal-portal.js` with the new
   one at the same file path (so your configuration doesn't need updating)

5. **Restart your AI app** to ensure it picks up the changes

If you have issues after upgrading, see the
[Troubleshooting Guide](#troubleshooting).

<br><br>

## LM Studio

Use Producer Pal completely offline without an Internet connection.

### Requirements

- [Ableton Live 12.2+](https://www.ableton.com/live/) with
  [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/live/max-for-live/)
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)

**⚠️ Experimental:** This requires a relatively new machine with decent specs
(Apple Silicon with lots of RAM or PCs with Nvidia 4080+ graphics cards). It
requires more technical know-how to setup and debug. The online options
documented above work significantly better and faster at the time of writing.
However, completely offline and private usage is compelling.

### Installation

1. Download
   [Producer_Pal.amxd](https://github.com/adamjmurray/producer-pal/releases/latest/download/Producer_Pal.amxd),
   the Producer Pal Max for Live device, and add it to a MIDI track in Ableton
   Live:

   <img src="./doc/img/producer-pal-running.png" alt="Producer Pal device running in Ableton Live" width="300">

   _It should display "Producer Pal Running" or something isn't working._

2. Optional / Recommended: In Producer Pal's "Advanced" tab, enable "Small Model
   Mode":

   <img src="./doc/img/small-model-mode.png" alt="small model mode setting" width="300">

   _This option is disabled by default and must be enabled each time you add
   Producer Pal to Live._

3. Install a compatible model in LM Studio, such as:
   - Qwen 3+ (4b-2507, 4b-thinking-2507)
   - OpenAI GPT-OSS (20B)
   - Mistral AI Magistral (small-2509)
   - Granite 4+ (4.0-h-tiny)
4. Setup Producer Pal in LM Studio Settings → Program → Integrations → edit
   mcp.json:

   **Option A: With producer-pal-portal.js (recommended)**:

   Download
   [producer-pal-portal.js](https://github.com/adamjmurray/producer-pal/releases/latest/download/producer-pal-portal.js)
   and configure:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       // ... other MCP server configs ...
       "producer-pal": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/producer-pal-portal.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Option B: Direct HTTP**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       // ... other MCP server configs ...
       "producer-pal": {
         "url": "http://localhost:3350/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   _When using direct HTTP, start Ableton Live with the Producer Pal device
   before enabling the Producer Pal MCP server inside LM Studio._

5. Confirm the Producer Pal tools are listed under Settings → Program:

   <img src="./doc/img/lm-studio-tool-list.png" alt="Producer Pal tools listed in LM Studio" width="250">

   _See below for tips on a subset of tools to use._

6. Start a conversation with Producer Pal MCP active and say "connect to
   ableton"

7. If you didn't enable "Allow all" under Settings → Program, then allow
   Producer Pal tools in the conversation:

   <img src="./doc/img/lm-studio-permissions.png" alt="LM Studio tool permission prompt" width="700">

   <img src="./doc/img/lm-studio-success.png" alt="LM Studio successfully connected to Producer Pal" width="700">

If it doesn't work, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](#troubleshooting).

### Local Model Tips

- A **context length of about 8k (8000)** is needed to start a conversation with
  Producer Pal and send a few messages.
- A **context length of 16k (16000) or higher is recommended** for achieving
  useful results, but higher context lengths can make the model run
  significantly slower, especially as the conversation grows. Experiment to find
  the right balance.
- To help the model make good tool choices and get more out of the limited
  context length, disable some of the Producer Pal tools. To focus on MIDI clip
  generation, a good minimal toolset for experimentation is:
  - `ppal-connect`
  - `ppal-read-live-set`
  - `ppal-read-track`
  - `ppal-create-clip`
  - `ppal-delete`
  - `ppal-playback`

  Try disabling all the other tools and add back when you miss features.

- Experiment with empty or extremely simple Live projects
- Only work with very simple material (e.g. basic MIDI patterns in clips 4 bars
  or shorter)
- Note that small models are guided to delete and start over rather make edits
  (other than simple additions)
- If the AI struggles and makes mistakes, don't hesitate to delete recent
  messages from the chat, edit your last message, and try again. Don't waste
  tokens correcting the LLM. Back up and avoid the issue or try something else.
- Shut down every other app you don't need to be running
- Consider running Ableton Live on a different machine on the local network
- When using a model with the GGUF engine, try enabling the
  advanced/experimental settings for Flash Attention and setting the K/V caches'
  quantization to Q8 or Q4.
- Research how to optimize for your specific machine / GPU hardware

#### Advanced: Customizing Skills

Local models vary widely in capabilities. **First, try enabling "Small Model
Mode" in Producer Pal's Advanced tab** (see LM Studio installation step 2
above) - this uses a simplified instruction set designed for smaller models.

If Small Model Mode isn't working well for you, or you want to experiment
further, you can customize Producer Pal's behavior for your specific model:

1. Download this repository and follow the dev setup and build instructions in
   [DEVELOPERS.md](./DEVELOPERS.md)
2. Edit `src/skills/basic.js` - the skills file used by Small Model Mode (or
   edit `src/skills/standard.js` to adjust regular mode)
3. Experiment with instruction wording, remove features your model struggles
   with, or adjust the guidance
4. Rebuild with `npm run build`
5. Use the development version of `Producer_pal.amxd` in Ableton Live
6. Reload your Producer Pal MCP server in LM Studio and start a new conversation

**Share your findings:** If you discover configurations that work well for
specific models, please share in
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/adamjmurray/producer-pal/discussions).
The community benefits from learning what works with different local models.

<br><br>

## Other MCP-compatible LLMs

Producer Pal works with any LLM that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### Requirements

- [Ableton Live 12.2+](https://www.ableton.com/live/) with
  [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/live/max-for-live/)
- AI that supports [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- Potentially: [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Installation

Download
[Producer_Pal.amxd](https://github.com/adamjmurray/producer-pal/releases/latest/download/Producer_Pal.amxd),
the Producer Pal Max for Live device, and add it to a MIDI track in Ableton
Live:

   <img src="./doc/img/producer-pal-running.png" alt="Producer Pal device running in Ableton Live" width="300">

_It should display "Producer Pal Running" or something isn't working._

Then, configure your AI to connect to Producer Pal using one of the following
methods.

#### Option A: Local MCP via stdio (recommended)

Download
[producer-pal-portal.js](https://github.com/adamjmurray/producer-pal/releases/latest/download/producer-pal-portal.js)
and configure your LLM MCP to use:

```bash
node /path/to/producer-pal-portal.js
```

This option requires [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

#### Option B: Local MCP via HTTP

Use the URL:

```
http://localhost:3350/mcp
```

Sometimes an additional setting is needed for HTTP connections. For example,
[Cline](https://cline.bot/) requires `"type": "streamableHttp"` to be configured
along with the `url` (see example below).

You may need to restart your AI app or refresh MCP servers if you forgot to run
Ableton Live with Producer Pal Max first.

#### Option C: Remote MCP via HTTP tunnel

For cloud-hosted LLMs or remote access:

1. Set up a [web tunnel](#web-tunnels) (e.g., ngrok, Pinggy)
2. Configure your LLM with the public URL + `/mcp`

#### Example: Configuring Cline

[Cline](https://cline.bot/) is an IDE plugin for AI that can be configured to
use Producer Pal in its `cline_mcp_settings.json` config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // ... other MCP server configs ...
    "producer-pal": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/producer-pal-portal.js"]
    },
    // OR
    "producer-pal-http": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "http://localhost:3350/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Once Producer Pal is configured, start a new chat with Producer Pal tools
enabled, say "connect to ableton" or "connect to ableton with your producer pal
tools", and allow the tools to be used:

<img src="./doc/img/cline-success.png" alt="using Producer Pal with Cline" width="450">

If it doesn't work, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](#troubleshooting).

<br><br>

## Web Tunnels

For remote access to Producer Pal from the Internet, you'll need a tunneling
service.

**⚠️ Security:** Producer Pal has no authentication. Anyone with your tunnel URL
can control Ableton Live. Keep the URL secret and only share with trusted
collaborators. If someone discovers it, restart your tunnel to get a new URL.

**For local networks** (studios, classrooms, performances): You don't need a
tunnel. Customize the port number in the Producer Pal device settings
(default: 3350) to prevent unauthorized access from other devices on the same
network. Update the `:3350` in your AI connection settings if you change it in
the Producer Pal Max for Live device.

### Cloudflare Quick Tunnels (Recommended)

- No account needed to get started

## Troubleshooting

### AI won't use Producer Pal

Verify your setup:

- Producer Pal Max for Live device is running in Ableton Live and displays
  "Producer Pal Running"
- Producer Pal tools are enabled in your AI app (most apps let you view
  available MCP tools/extensions)
- If either was missing, start a new conversation. If that doesn't work, restart
  your AI app completely.

If the AI claims it can't interact with Ableton Live:

1. Ask "what tools do you have?"
2. Verify it lists Producer Pal tools like `ppal-connect`
3. Say "call your ppal-connect tool"

Once ppal-connect is called, Producer Pal should work. If "connect to ableton"
doesn't trigger it, try:

- "connect to ableton with your tools"
- "connect to ableton with your ppal-connect tool"

If tools are visible but the AI won't call them, check you're using a model that
supports tool calling. Many local models (including some in LM Studio) don't
support tools.

### Connection Issues

- Ensure Producer Pal device is loaded and running in Ableton Live
- Check that port 3350 is not blocked by firewall
- For remote connections, verify your tunnel is active

### MCP Server Not Found

- Verify the full path to `producer-pal-portal.js` is correct
- Ensure Node.js is installed and accessible from your terminal

### Tools Not Appearing

- Toggle the Producer Pal device off and on in Live
- Restart your AI interface
- Check the Max console for error messages

### After Upgrading

If Producer Pal stops working after installing a new version:

- **Claude Desktop users:** Make sure you uninstalled the old extension before
  installing the new one
- **All users:** Verify you replaced both the `.amxd` device AND the portal/mcpb
  files (if applicable for your installation)
- Try deleting and re-adding the Producer Pal device in Ableton Live
- Restart your AI app completely
- Start a fresh conversation
