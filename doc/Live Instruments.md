# Ideas

- Maybe this info should be embedded into Producer Pal (e.g. the read-song tool
  instructions)
- If the user is prompted to share their edition of Ableton Live, actionable
  suggestions for instrument choices can be given, and assistance programming
  Live's older, well-known instruments can be given.
- Once we build out the @Customization and Adaptive Learning Roadmap.md plan,
  the user could indicate their edition of Live in the user context (because it
  seems it cannot be programmatically determined via the Live API and anyway,
  they might have purchased individual instruments from Ableton, so they could
  list out that info in the user context too)
- The user could also share their list of instrument plugins (VST, AU) to aid
  with sound selection and synth programming. AI probably can give lots of
  guidance on programming Serum v1 for example, and a lot of that might
  translate well to Serum v2 (and they'll know more about Serum v2 over time as
  new models are released)
