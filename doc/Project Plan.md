# Producer Pal Project Plan

## âœ… Completed Work

**Core Infrastructure:**

- MCP server with StreamableHttp transport integration
- Max for Live device with Node.js (MCP server) and Live API integration
- Device UI with port configuration and status indicators
- Claude Desktop extension with graceful fallback when Live isn't running
- Rollup-based build system
- Comprehensive test coverage (~90% overall)

**Complete CRUD Operations:**

- **Clips**: Full CRUD with note manipulation, playback control, incremental
  editing
- **Tracks**: Full CRUD with properties, drum pad detection, grouped track
  support
- **Scenes**: Full CRUD with capture functionality
- **Live Set**: Transport control, tempo/time signature, view switching

**Notation System:**

- Custom LLM-friendly `bar|beat` music notation format for MIDI clips (parser
  with PEG grammar + custom formatter)
- Velocity and duration control with probability support
- Time signature support beyond 4/4

**Advanced Features:**

- Session and Arrangement view support with comprehensive duplication
- Bulk operations (create/update/delete/play/stop multiple objects)
- Duplicate operations for tracks, scenes, and clips with arrangement
  integration
- Session-to-arrangement duplication with length control

**Robustness Features:**

- Optimistic response strategy to avoid LLM fix-it loops
- Comprehensive error handling
- Max console error capture used to transmit warnings
- Timeouts for overly-long-running operations
- Track Producer Pal host detection and protection

## ðŸ“‹ Focus Areas & TODOs

### Pre-1.0.0 (Critical Path)

#### 0.9.0

- [x] Open-source the codebase and establish versioned releases

#### 0.9.1

- [x] Welcome message / tips in read-song tool description
- [x] Add device listing to read-song and read-track

#### 0.9.2

- [x] Ability to read and write track I/O routings and monitoring state in the
      `read-song`, `read-track`, and `update-track` tools
- [x] "Route to source" feature for tracks in the `duplicate` tool, for layering
      multiple tracks of MIDI clips routing to the same instrument. It's a
      shortcut for:
  1. duplicate a track with no clips or devices (no devices is required to route
     MIDI output from MIDI tracks)
  2. route the new track's output to the source track
  3. set the source track monitoring to "In" (so the track doesn't have to be
     armed to hear the new tracks)
  4. set the source track input routing type to "No input" (to prevent unwanted
     external input after switching to "In" monitoring)
- [x] Allow MIDI passthrough in the Max for Live device

#### 0.9.3

See `doc/Per Project Context and Tabbed UI Spec.md`

- [x] Tabbed UI for the Max for Live device
- [x] Fix flaw in release process where extension package lock is updated after
      commit for version bump
- [x] Adjust desktop extension param to support full URL and not just port
      number (goal: control machine on same LAN)
- [x] Per-Live-Project Context (Customization Phase 1)
- [ ] AI-writable Project Context (Learning Phase 1)

#### 0.9.4

Misc stuff & polish before 1.0.0

- [ ] Change Arrangement clip length
- [ ] Improve Producer Pal logo design
- [ ] Make demo video and add to README and web site

### ðŸš€ 1.0.0 Release

\_Stable, documented, user-friendly baseline

### Post-1.0.0

#### 1.x - Miscellaneous Cleanup

_TODO: Split this apart into separate minor or patch releases intermixed with
bigger product features in the 1.x line (see below)_

- [ ] Streamline installation process: Install Claude Desktop extension and have
      the extension install/update the Max for Live device to a standard Live
      User Library location on demand. The MCP proxy in the extension could
      generate an additional tool `install-max-for-live-device` when the
      connection to Ableton Live cannot be established and prompt the user to
      use it. Open questions: how best to handle custom Live Library Locations?
      As a desktop extension parameter or on-the-fly in the AI chat?
- [ ] Implement version update notifications in the UI
- [ ] Optional toggle in device UI to suppress Max console errors (maybe this is
      a bad idea for robustness, but it could be an advanced setting hidden in a
      settings tab though. basically, it's an "escape hatch" if this mechanism
      is causing unwanted behaviors)
- [ ] Duplicate Tool response format improvements
- [ ] Improved mocking system with unified interface for LiveAPI objects
- [ ] State Sync: ID-first operations, smart error recovery (see doc/Better
      State Sync Plan.md)
- [ ] Address the duplicate track name issues in duplicate.routeToSource (see
      dedicated md file in docs explaining the issue and potential solutions)
- [ ] Standardized validation system and consistent handling of errors (thrown
      exceptions) and warning ( console.error messages)

#### 1.1.0 - Customization

- [ ] Customization Phase 1: Per-project context (NOTE: now planned for pre-1.0)
- [ ] Customization Phase 2: Global context
- [ ] Customization Phase 3: JSON override system

#### 1.5.0 - Device Control

- [ ] Randomize instrument rack macros
- [ ] R&D: additional Device & Effect Control possibilities (rack parameters,
      plugin params, one day: automation if the Live API eventually supports it)

#### 2.0.0 - Learning & Personas

- [ ] Customization Phase 4: Learning system with backups

#### 2.1.0 - Personas

- [ ] Customization Phase 5: Persona system

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

For 3.x or to pull into one of the above releases when ideas become more fully
baked.

**Advanced Composition Features:**

- Randomization tools (velocity, timing, shuffle)
- Slice & shuffle tools
- Pattern generation algorithms
- Advanced pattern manipulation
- Auto-arrangement suggestions
