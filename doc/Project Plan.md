### üîÑ State Synchronization & Robustness

**Phase 1: User Education (Immediate)**

- [ ] Update tool descriptions to guide users about state sync
- [ ] Add refresh instructions when objects move
- [ ] Improve error messages for moved/deleted objects

**Phase 2: Technical Improvements**

- [ ] ID-first operations for all tools
- [ ] Smart error recovery with fallback to IDs
- [ ] Object validation tool
- [ ] Automatic state synchronization (future)

### üéØ New User Experience (NUX)

**Phase 1: Minimal (Ship Now)**

- [ ] Add movement/sync tip to first read-song

**Phase 2: Safety & Core Features**

- [ ] Welcome message with capabilities overview
- [ ] Save reminder for data safety
- [ ] Basic prompt suggestions

**Phase 3: Progressive Disclosure**
