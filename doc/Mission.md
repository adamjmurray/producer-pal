## Producer Pal's Mission

- Supplement, complement, enhance, and amplify human creativity. Don't replace
  human creativity!

- Help people get unblocked when they're creatively blocked.

- Make it easier to experiment with music in terms of high level ideas instead
  of the low level piano roll events.

- Facilitate life-long learning by teaching people things they didn't know about
  music theory, composition, and arrangement.

- Help people with disabilities produce music (assuming Claude Desktop or an
  alternative chat client can be used in a hands-free voice mode, this should be
  possible)
