# Mutation Testing

Mutation testing validates **test efficacy**, not just coverage. The suite
already enforces 99%+ line/statement and 100% function coverage — but coverage
measures _execution_, not _fault detection_. A test can run a line and assert
nothing. Mutation testing closes that gap: it introduces small faults
("mutants") into the source and checks whether the suite fails. A **surviving
mutant** is a behavior change no test caught — a concrete test-quality gap.

Tool: [Stryker Mutator](https://stryker-mutator.io/) with the Vitest runner. The
full CI-rollout plan (scheduled matrix, incremental PR checks, priority areas)
is tracked as project work; the matrix sketch is inlined under "Status & next
steps" below.

## Running

```bash
npm run mutation
```

This is **scoped to `src/notation/`** and is deliberately **not** part of
`npm run check` — a full pass takes minutes, too slow for the per-PR hot path.

- Config: `config/stryker.config.mjs`
- HTML report (gitignored): `reports/mutation/notation.html` — open it to browse
  survivors per file with the exact source diff of each mutant.
- Reruns are incremental (`reports/mutation/stryker-incremental.json`, also
  gitignored): after the first full pass, only mutants in changed files re-run.

The config reuses the project `vitest.config.ts`, so path aliases (`#src` etc.),
the test environment, and env flags all apply unchanged.
`coverageAnalysis: "perTest"` means each mutant only re-runs the tests that
cover it, not the whole ~8k-test suite — this is the main reason a run is
minutes, not hours.

## Baseline (2026-07-14, `src/notation/`)

Current full pass — Stryker 9.6.1, Node 24, `coverageAnalysis: "perTest"`:

| Metric                     | Value      |
| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Mutation score**         | **86.90%** |
| Mutants killed             | 3846       |
| Survived                   | 577        |
| Timeout (counts as killed) | 53         |
| No coverage                | 11         |
| Errors (non-compiling)     | 0          |
| Total mutants              | 4487       |
| Wall-clock                 | 7m 31s     |
| Avg tests run per mutant   | 25.6       |

The gate is **ratcheted**: `thresholds.break = 86` in the config, so a run fails
(exit 1) if the score drops below 86% — ~1 point of headroom below the current
score for run-to-run timeout-classification variance (a timeout counts as
killed, so it nudges the score). Raise the floor as the score climbs; never
lower it without triaging the regression.

Lowest-scoring files (remaining triage targets):

| File                                                                | Score | Survived |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| `barbeat/interpreter/helpers/barbeat-interpreter-buffer-helpers.ts` | 78.5% | 14       |
| `transform/transform-audio-evaluator.ts`                            | 78.7% | 64       |
| `barbeat/serializer/helpers/barbeat-serializer-drum.ts`             | 81.2% | 26       |
| `stark/stark-serializer.ts`                                         | 82.7% | 33       |

These are **not** cheap wins: the survivors cluster on `± *_EPSILON` boundary
flips (killing them over-fits to a ~1e-9 / 0.001 slack), warning/error message
strings, and equivalent mutants (e.g. a `.sort()` that is provably a no-op
because its input is already ascending). Triage before acting.

Clean (100%): `barbeat-apply-v0-deletions.ts`.

### Gaps closed

**2026-07-14** — `chords/chord-symbols.ts` jumped **73.3% → 96.7%**. A
golden-spec table test now asserts every one of the ~44 chord qualities resolves
to the correct intervals — 24 qualities (`min6`, `m7b5`'s cousins, all the
9/11/13 extensions, …) were reachable but unasserted, so blanking their interval
rows survived. Targeted tests also cover the slash-bass-equals-root octave drop
and invalid-root rejection. `stark/stark-serializer.ts` gained an unsorted-input
test: `walkLine` sorts notes by start time, but every prior test already fed
sorted input, so the sort was untested.

| Gap (now killed)                                           | Test added in              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 24 unasserted chord qualities → interval spec              | `chord-symbols.test.ts`    |
| Slash bass equal to the root drops an octave (`>=` vs `>`) | `chord-symbols.test.ts`    |
| Invalid root letter with an accidental is rejected         | `chord-symbols.test.ts`    |
| Serializer sorts unsorted input by start time              | `stark-serializer.test.ts` |

**2026-06-28** — first triage closed three bucket-1 survivors:
`resolveSplitPoints` de-dupe + ascending sort of cut points, the
`MAX_NOTE_PIECES` clamp boundary, and the `validateBufferedState` `buffered > 0`
guard (in `transform-split-note-op.test.ts` and
`barbeat-interpreter-helpers.test.ts`).

## Interpreting survivors

Each survivor falls into one of three buckets — triage before acting:

1. **Real test gap** — the mutated behavior matters but nothing asserts on it.
   Add/strengthen an assertion. This is the payoff.
2. **Equivalent mutant** — the mutation produces behavior indistinguishable from
   the original (e.g. `<=` vs `<` on a bound that's never hit, reordering
   commutative ops). Not fixable; ignore. Stryker can't detect these
   automatically.
3. **Weak-but-acceptable** — defensive code, log strings, or output formatting
   where an assertion would be over-fitting. Judgement call.

`# no coverage` mutants are lines no test exercises at all — usually the easiest
wins, and a cross-check against the line-coverage gate.

## Status & next steps

The gate is **ratcheted** (`thresholds.break = 86`) but still **scoped to
`src/notation/`** and off the per-PR hot path (a full pass is minutes).
Remaining work (later releases):

- Keep triaging the ~588 survivors, but expect diminishing returns: the dense
  clusters left are epsilon-boundary / warning-string / equivalent mutants
  (bucket 2/3), so genuine bucket-1 gaps are now sparse.
- Raise `thresholds.break` as the score climbs.
- Widen `mutate` to `src/tools/` (write operations first), likely as a scheduled
  (nightly/weekly) non-blocking CI job — full-tree runtime is hours, not
  minutes.

### CI-rollout sketch

A full-tree run is ~8–20 hours, so it can't be per-commit — but GitHub Actions
is free for public repos with a 6-hour hard cap per job. Split the tree into
module groups running as parallel matrix jobs, each in its own 6-hour window
(the slowest module is likely 2–3 hours, well under the cap):

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 3 * * 1" # Weekly Monday 3am UTC
jobs:
  mutation-test:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        mutate:
          - "src/notation/**/*.ts"
          - "src/tools/clip/**/*.ts"
          - "src/tools/track/**/*.ts"
          - "src/tools/device/**/*.ts"
          - "src/tools/actions/**/*.ts"
          - "src/tools/{scene,control,live-set,workflow}/**/*.ts"
    steps:
      - run: npx stryker run --mutate '${{ matrix.mutate }}'
      # Upload HTML report as artifact
```

After the first full run, `--incremental` mode only re-tests mutants in changed
files, bringing per-PR runs down to minutes — viable as a non-blocking check.

**Priority areas when widening** (high-risk first):

1. **Write operations** (`update-*`, `create-*`, `delete`) — weak assertions
   here could mask bugs that modify Live Sets.
2. **Recently migrated test files** — the 83 files touched in the mock registry
   migration are most likely to have weakened assertions.
3. **Arrangement operations** — complex edge cases around clip splitting,
   tiling, and boundary detection.
