# Add .als files here that are referenced by scenarios in ../scenarios/
# These files should be version controlled as they define the test environment.
#
# Example files:
#   - empty-project.als: An empty Live project with Producer Pal device
#   - drums-bass-chords.als: A project with existing drum, bass, and chord tracks
